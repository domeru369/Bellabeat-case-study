# About The Company
Bellabeat, a health-focused tech company founded by Urška Sršen, empowers women with health data through its smart devices. Despite early success and diverse marketing channels, Sršen believes user data holds untapped growth potential. She tasks the marketing analytics team to analyze user behavior and translate those insights into high-level marketing strategies for Bellabeat.

# Scenerio
As a data analyst at Bellabeat, a company revolutionizing women’s health with its smart devices, I’m tasked with delving into user data. Our goal? Unearth hidden gems within fitness data specific to our Bellabeat product. This user behavior analysis will be the key to unlocking new market growth for Bellabeat. By understanding how women currently utilize their smart devices, I can translate those insights into high-level marketing strategies, presented directly to the Bellabeat executive team. This data-driven approach will propel Bellabeat towards becoming a major force in the global smart device market.

# Business Task
* Analyze user data specifically focused on fitness metrics collected through Fitbit dataset. 
* Gain and translate insights into actionable marketing strategies for Bellabeat. 
* Presentation of findings and recommendations to the Bellabeat executive team. 
* Leverage user data to unlock new growth opportunities/market strategies and propel Bellabeat towards becoming a major player in the global smart device market.

# Data Analysis Process
# 1. Ask 
Sršen asks me to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart
devices. She then wants me to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in my presentation. These questions will guide my analysis:
* What are some trends in smart device usage?
* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

# 2. Prepare 
I am using a public dataset from Kaggle pointed out by Sršen. The FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius) that explores smart device users’ daily habits.This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and weight that can be used to explore users’ habits.

# Information about the Dataset
* The dataset is generated by respondents from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.
* 30 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
* Data collected includes physical activity recorded in minutes, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity and steps.

# Limitations of the Data
* The data lacks crucial demographic information like age, occupation, location and gender.
* The data does not represent the entire Fitbit user base. Users who choose to share their data might have different habits compared to the general population.
* The data was collected 7 years ago in 2016. Technology and user behavior related to fitness trackers may have evolved since then.

# 3. Process
* I chose daily activities, hourly activities(hourly steps and hourly calories), sleep and weight as metrics for this analysis because they provide a more comprehensive picture of user behavior and health.
* I chose R to perform analysis because it excels at statistical analysis, which is crucial for tasks like examining correlations between sleep, activity, and weight in the Fitbit data. R also offers powerful tools for data visualization through packages like ggplot2.
* I performed Exploratary Data Analysis (EDA) in order to ensure my data is clean by calling out head, str, colnames, rename, glimpse, view, na, duplicated functions. By doing this, I ensured that there are no missing values, duplicates and  all data types are consistent through out all datasets to enable efficient merging. 
* I  manipulated the date column by extracting weekdays in order to analyze trends in the data in relation to days. I also called out the summary function in order to get summary statistics of the data which provides a snapshot of the data, offering valuable insights into its central tendencies, spread, and potential issues.

* Sedentary minutes are consistently higher than other activity minutes (very active, fairly active, and light active) in the Fitbit data, 
* It reveals a predominantly inactive lifestyle for the users generally. A high percentage of sedentary minutes indicates the user spends most of their day sitting, lying down, or engaging in activities with minimal physical exertion.

# 5. Share
## Key Findings 
### a) Data Completeness:
* Not all users tracked sleep and weight consistently. There is more complete data for daily activity and hourly steps (914 records, 33 users) compared to sleep (414 records, 24 users) and weight (68 records, 8 users).

### b) Sleep Analysis:
* Users slept an average of 6 hours 59 minutes (419.2 minutes) and spent an average of 7 hours 28 minutes (448.5 minutes) in bed.
* There's a positive correlation between total sleep time and total time in bed, indicating good sleep hygiene for many users.
* Wednesday nights showed the highest average sleep duration, while Mondays had the lowest.
* There's a weak negative correlation between sleep duration and total steps, suggesting a slight tendency for people who sleep more to take fewer steps on average (and vice versa). However, the effect is weak, and other factors likely play a bigger role.
  
### c) Activity Analysis:
* There's a weak positive correlation between total steps and both very active minutes and average intensity, indicating that users who take more steps tend to engage in slightly more intense activity.
* There's a positive correlation between total steps and calories burned, as expected with increased activity leading to higher calorie expenditure.
* Tuesdays showed the highest average steps and calorie expenditure compared to other days, with Sundays and Mondays having the lowest.
* People tend to be more active in the evening (5pm-6pm) compared to mornings (12am-7am).

### d) Body Composition:
* There's a negative relationship between total steps/calories burned and BMI. This suggests a trend where people with lower BMIs tend to be more active, while those with higher BMIs tend to be less active.

### e) Sedentary Behavior:
* Sedentary minutes are consistently higher than other activity minutes, indicating a significant portion of the day is spent inactive.
* There's a weak negative correlation between sleep duration and sedentary minutes, but it's not a strong relationship. Further investigation into factors like occupation, age, and gender might be needed to understand high sedentary time.


# Recommendations
* Highlight the Sleep Benefits of Activity: Marketing materials can emphasize how increased activity can contribute to better sleep, which is crucial for overall health and well-being.
* Promote Evening Activity Routines: Encourage users to incorporate short bursts of activity into their evenings (outside of the typical 5pm-6pm peak) to help manage weight and improve overall health.
* Focus on Holistic Health: Move beyond just steps and emphasize the importance of a balanced lifestyle that includes good sleep, a healthy diet, and regular physical activity of varying intensities.
* Develop Educational Content: Offer informative content within the app or through other channels to educate users on the connection between sleep, activity, weight management, and overall well-being.
* Target Specific User Groups: Consider segmenting your marketing efforts based on user data (e.g., sleep duration, activity levels) to provide more tailored recommendations and support healthier habits.
* Address Sedentary Behavior: Develop strategies to help users reduce sedentary time throughout the day. This could involve reminders to get up and move, challenges that incorporate short activity breaks, or promoting specific features within the app that address inactivity.
By leveraging these insights and recommendations, Bellabeat can develop a more comprehensive marketing strategy that empowers women to take control of their health and well-being through a holistic approach that considers sleep, activity, and overall lifestyle habits.
